Checkpoint 7 Writeup
====================

My name: [Vladimir  Gonzalez Migal]

My SUNet ID: [vladgm24]

I collaborated with: [list sunetids here]

I would like to thank/reward these classmates for their help: [moserj, siwooahn]

This checkpoint took me about [2] hours to do. I [did] attend the lab session.

Solo portion:

- Did your implementation successfully start and end a conversation with another copy of itself? [y]

- Did it successfully transfer a one-megabyte file, with contents identical upon receipt? [y]

- Please describe what code changes, if any, were necessary to pass these steps: none

Group portion:

- Who is your lab partner moserj & siwooahn ?

- Did your implementations successfully start and end a conversation with each other (with each implementation acting as ``client'' or as ``server'')? My implementation worked as both a client and a server.

- Did you successfully transfer a one-megabyte file between your two
  implementations, with contents identical upon receipt? yes, my client and server was able to receive and send a one megabyte file identically. In both cases we had the same sha code. 

- Please describe what code changes, if any, were necessary to pass
  these steps, either by you or your lab partner.
